Pipes are the way to transform the view values before displaying them in HTML.

### A pipe transforms the given input in to a desired output.

Many built-in pipes are available. Few of them are the wellknown `uppercase`, `lowercase`, `date` pipes.

#### Built-in pipes`

Let's see how to use a built-in pipe.


`src/app/toys/toys.component.html`

```html
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let toy of toys">
      {{toy.color}} {{ toy.name | titlecase}}
    </li>
  </ul>
```
Pipe should be added to the right of the `|` pipe symbol , inside the interpolation expression.

Here, `titlecase` is the built-in pipe to display the `toyname` in titlecase.

We can also pass parameters to the pipe.

`src/app/toys/toys.component.html`

```html
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let toy of toys | slice:1:3">
    {{toy.color}} {{ toy.name | titlecase}}
  </li>
</ul>
```
`slice` is the pipe name and parameters to the pipe `1` and `3` are seperated by a `:`
1 and 3 are the start and end indexes to be sliced.

Here is how the ouptut looks like:

And we can `chain` any number of pipes in an expression just by adding it after adittional `|` symbol.

<!-- #### Custom pipe -->

We'll see how to build our own custom pipe in the upcoming post.
