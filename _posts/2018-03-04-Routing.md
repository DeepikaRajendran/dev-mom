In this post, we'll see in detail about Routing in Angular.

As part of Routing Implementation, let's create another component in our App and try navigating between component templates.

```
ng g c dashboard
```
`g` is the shortcut for `generate`

`c` for `component`

For initial Angular Project setup, refer [here](https://deepikarajendran.github.io/dev-mom/angular-setup-with-angular-cli/).

`dashboard` folder will be created and
`Angular CLI` imports and add the `DashboardComponent` to the `declarations` array of the `app.module.ts`.

Update the `app.component.html` file to add links to `Dashboard` and `Toys` section.

```html
<mat-toolbar color="accent">
  <mat-icon>child_care</mat-icon>  
  <a mat-button> Dashboard</a>
  <a mat-button> Toys</a>
  <span class="space"></span>
</mat-toolbar>

<app-toys></app-toys>
```
Now, let's move on to the implementing the Routing part.

#### Import Router
Go to `app.module.ts` and import constants `RoutingModule`, `Routes` from `@angular/router` package in order to use Router.

```typescript
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
```
#### Configure the Routes
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'home', component: DashboardComponent },
  { path: 'toys', component: ToysComponent }
];
```
In order to use the component in `component` property, above components should be imported.

We have two router definitions in the array of `routes`.

`path` is the URL to the component.

`component` property hold the value of the component, from where the page logic and page content is being handled.

To make all these routes available, install them to the `imports` array.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
  ],
  imports: [
    RouterModule.forRoot(routes)
  ],
  providers: [ColorPipe, ToysService],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```
#### RouterOutlet

Now, go to `app.component.html` and replace `<app-toys></app-toys>` selector with `<router-outlet></router-outlet>`.

```html
<mat-toolbar color="accent">
  <mat-icon>child_care</mat-icon>  
  <a mat-button> Dashboard</a>
  <a mat-button> Toys</a>
  <span class="space"></span>
</mat-toolbar>

<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```
`routerOutlet` directive is a placeholder, where the contents of the corresponding route will be substituted, keeping the outer template same for all the routes of the app.

Open the app in browser,

```
 ng serve --open
```
`--open` will open the url in default browser.

By default, the browser URL shows the content from dashboard template `dashboard works!`.

And when you hit `http://localhost:4200/toys`
, it shows the toy template, keeping the `toolbar` section same for both routes.

#### RouterLink

Now, let's add the navigating link to `dashboard` and `toys` `<a>` tag to have user click and navigate through the app.

`app.component.html`
```html
<mat-toolbar color="accent">
  <mat-icon>child_care</mat-icon>  
  <a mat-button routerLink="/"> Dashboard</a>
  <a mat-button routerLink="/toys"> Toys</a>
  <span class="space"></span>
</mat-toolbar>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```
`RouterLink` directive is used to link to the routes with no page reload. 

#### Redirection
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full'},
  { path: 'home', component: DashboardComponent },
  { path:'toys', component: ToysComponent }
];
```
`redirectTo` property says to redirect to the route of path with value `home`, when the remaining URL is `''`.

`pathMatch` property is required in `redirect` route to say how to match a URL to the path of the route, whether it is `full` or `prefix`.

For more details on `pathMatch` property, refer [here](https://angular.io/guide/router#redirecting-routes).

#### ActivatedRoute
`ActivatedRoute` service keeps track of the information on the current route.

`app.module.ts`
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full'},
  { path: 'home', component: DashboardComponent },
  { path: 'toys/:id', component: ToysComponent },
  { path:'toys', component: ToysComponent }
];
```
To get details about the specific toy, pass the `id` property of the toy as query parameter.

Import `ActivatedRoute` and get the toy `id` passed as query parameter from the current route.

`toys.component.ts`
```typescript
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
```
```typescript
constructor(private toysService: ToysService, private route:ActivatedRoute) {}
```
```typescript
ngOnInit() {    
    this.route.params.subscribe(params => {
      console.log(params["id"]);
    });          
}
```
`params` property is an Observable that contains the required and optional parameters specific to the route. Use paramMap instead.

For details on other properties, refer [here](https://angular.io/guide/router#activated-route).
